# EUV — grand strategy in your terminal

A turn-based grand strategy game inspired by Europa Universalis and
Victoria, played entirely in the terminal. Guide one of 14 nations on the
fictional continent of **Eryndor** through a century of blood and gold:
develop your provinces, forge alliances, fabricate claims, win wars, and
out-score your rivals before the age ends — without provoking a coalition
that tears you apart.

Zero dependencies. Pure Python standard library (curses).

## Running

Requires Python 3.10+ and a terminal of at least **100x30** (256-color
recommended). No installation needed:

```sh
python3 -m euv             # random world
python3 -m euv --seed 7    # a specific world
```

Or install the `euv` command with `pip install .`

## The game

Each turn is one month, from AE 800 to AE 900. When the century ends the
nations are ranked by score (development ×2 + prestige + treasury/20) —
but the real goal is survival and dominance on your own terms.

- **Economy** — provinces pay tax by development. Develop them, build
  farms, markets, barracks, forts and temples, and keep stability up.
  Going bankrupt shatters your realm.
- **Military** — recruit regiments against a force limit, maneuver army
  stacks, hire generals, and let armies siege enemy provinces (or retake
  your own). Battles weigh numbers, morale, generals, dice and defensive
  terrain. Manpower is a slow-recovering pool; war exhaustion erodes
  morale the longer you fight. Provinces have a **supply limit**
  (3 + dev×0.6 regiments, less in mountains/desert/marsh, +2 on own or
  allied soil): a nation's regiments stacked beyond it take monthly
  attrition, so doomstacks bleed — spread out. Toggle reinforcement per
  army with `i` to stop a wounded stack draining your manpower. The game
  autosaves every January.
- **Diplomacy** — opinions, alliances, truces and calls to arms.
  Fabricate claims to get cheap casus belli. Warscore from occupations
  and battles buys provinces and gold at the peace table.
- **Aggressive expansion** — every conquest scares the neighbours.
  Push too fast and a hostile coalition will form and strike.
- **Missions** — rotating objectives (conquest, development, alliances…)
  that pay gold and prestige, and grant claims for conquest goals.
- **A living world** — AI nations develop, ally, scheme, declare wars on
  each other, and sue for peace. Nations die; great powers rise.
  Random events with meaningful choices punctuate the century.

## Controls

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrows / `hjkl` | Move map cursor |
| `Enter` | Select province / confirm move / cycle armies here |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle your armies |
| `Space` | End turn (1 month) — `>` plays up to 12 months |
| `m` | Move selected army (pick destination, `Enter`) |
| `x` / `X` | Split / disband army |
| `G` | Hire a general for the selected army |
| `i` | Toggle reinforcement for the selected army |
| `r` / `R` | Recruit one regiment / up to force limit |
| `d` / `b` | Develop province / build building |
| `c` | Fabricate claim on a border province |
| `D` | Diplomacy (relations, alliances, war, peace) |
| `+` | Raise stability |
| `1 2 3 4` | Map modes: political, terrain, development, diplomatic |
| `o` / `g` | Ledger of nations / chronicle (full log) |
| `?` | Help |
| `S` / `L` / `q` | Save / load / quit |

Map legend: three-letter tags mark province owners, `*N` markers are army
stacks (N regiments), `!` marks an active siege, striped provinces are
occupied, `~` is the sea. Terrain glyphs: `.` plains, `f` forest,
`n` hills, `^` mountains, `:` desert, `m` marsh.

## Development

The world is generated deterministically from a seed: a hand-shaped
landmass is partitioned into 52 provinces by flood-fill, grouped into 14
nations across five cultures, then named and flavoured. The engine is
fully headless-testable; the curses UI sits on top.

```sh
bash tests/run_all.sh           # everything below
python3 tests/sim.py 7 100      # 100-year all-AI balance simulation
python3 tests/tui_driver.py     # scripted TUI session in a pty (pyte)
python3 tests/tui_war.py        # war & peace-negotiation UI flow
python3 tests/tui_campaign.py   # full campaign: march, siege, peace
python3 tests/tui_fuzz.py       # 350 random keys must not crash
```

Module map: `worldgen.py` (map/nations), `model.py` (state),
`engine.py` (turn tick, combat, diplomacy, peace, missions, events),
`ai.py` (AI economy/war/peace/coalitions), `render.py` (curses drawing,
popups), `app.py` (input & game flow), `save.py` (JSON save/load),
`data.py` (constants, names, events).
